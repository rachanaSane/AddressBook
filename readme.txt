Assumptions

- Address Book name should be unique
- While comparing address books, names are case sensetive.
- Contact Name inside Address book need not be unique.
- only 2 address books could be compared. But code is written such a way that it could be extended if required to support multiple address books.
- Search for unique contact names across address books is case sensetive.
